    "The `shapely` package in Python is a powerful library for geometric operations and manipulation of planar geometric objects. It is commonly used for tasks related to spatial analysis, such as working with points, lines, polygons, and performing various geometric operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key features and functionalities of the `shapely` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Objects**: `shapely` provides classes for creating and manipulating various geometric objects, including `Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`, `MultiLineString`, and `MultiPolygon`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Operations**: You can perform a wide range of geometric operations, such as intersections, unions, differences, buffering, and more, on these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predicates**: `shapely` offers predicates to check relationships between geometric objects, such as containment, touch, overlap, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Analysis**: You can calculate properties of geometric objects, such as area, length, perimeter, and centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometry Validation**: The package provides tools to validate and fix invalid geometries, ensuring they conform to the specifications.\n",
